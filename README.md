# The Phansite

This is my crude implementation of the [Phantom Aficionado Website](https://megamitensei.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom_Aficionado_Website), or simply the "Phan-site" from the popular JRPG series - *Persona 5*. The original concept of the game can be explored on [Persona 5's official website](https://persona.atlus.com/p5r/).

## Motivation and Goals

This project serves as a practical exercise to deepen my understanding of web development concepts with a fun exercise. As I like this video game a lot, I found this an engaging way to apply and improve my skills in a project I am passionate about.

## Future Plans

Moving forward, I plan to expand and refine the website. I intend to make further improvements and polish the design of the website to make it a more comprehensive homage to the game. :)
